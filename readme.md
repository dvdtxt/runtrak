#  RunTrak

Simple web app made to learn flask and python.

The main idea is to record the progress of the training/running sessions in real life, so I can check the progress or evolution (if there's any).

The data is entered through a form, to sqlite, and it's represented in some simple graphs.

### TODO:
+ Improve Graphs
+ Secure db input/output
+ Select time range in report
